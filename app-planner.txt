The name of the group of tech websites I create: Tech Colossus

Health Website.  Teach people how to improve their immune systems the right way to defend against the next COVID
  Not sure exactly how, but I will have to do something that can help people to immunize themselves for real.  They don't need 
  a vaccine, in fact they'd be better off without one; what they do need is a strong, healthy immune system that does its job.

Global Warming Debunker (True name pending...)
  Collects weather data for each day for select city/cities.
  Logs the weather data for each day, including the day's high, low, and average temp.
  Calculates average temperature for the month, the season, and the year.
  Charts and compares the average temperatures in each subsequent year, decade, and century.

  Every year the results will get better and better.  Before long, I will have evidence that what the climate changers have 
  been claiming is demonstrably false.  Or, I will find that they were right all along.  Either way, I win, because I am on the
  side of truth.

True Science
  This could be a super set of the health site and the climate research site.  It could include a couple of other things, too.

  What is true science?
    Science vs. Philosophy vs. Groupthink
    The Scientific Method
    The True Scientist vs. The False Scientist
    True Science (Science) vs. False Science ("The Science")

True History
  If I do True Science and that ends up working out, I can try out doing True History, too.
  Comprehensive History of the World, including Scriptural truths, that put all things into perspective.
  Go Broad and then get technical
    Start with a particular time period, covering what was happening in the world at large, and then zero in to specific 
    accounts focused on certain groups, if we have them.
    Because it's a website instead of a book, it can be updated continuously and arranged in a number of creative ways.

Travel Buddy
  Focus on the conversions first, and then expand from there.
  As this is an app/website, it can be updated continuously, and therefore does not have to be released in its perfect form 
  right from the start.
  My niche clients should still be those who are either living abroad or often travel abroad, as they are the ones who would 
  need to make foreign conversions often enough to find an app like this worth downloading.

  Something else to consider is an app especially for ALTs living in Japan.  
    Additional useful features to consider:
      Delayed notification for those out of the country: will not chime until a set local time for them.
      Japanese Language Learning Resources
      JET Prep Checklist
        Starting as early as before the application process and leading right up to Departure
        Can also extend to while they are there and even have a few things for after they return (if they return)

  People are going to have to learn how to keep themselves healthy.  The doctors are not going to be as much help as they used 
  to be, and let's be honest, they were never really that helpful to begin with.  

  The true order of the immune system is to keep a man completely healthy at all times.  A healthy, full-powered immune system,
  operating at peak capacity should
